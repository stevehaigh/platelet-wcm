# Lab book — 2026-05-11: deYoung-Keizer IP3R replacement (issue #27)

## Why this change

The resting-state ODE converges to [Ca²⁺]_cyt ≈ 2 240 nM and
[Ca²⁺]_DTS ≈ 0.07 µM. The DTS drains even without IP3 stimulus.
Full root-cause analysis is in #24 and lab-book-2026-05-07-dts-drain
-investigation.md; the finding in brief:

Sneyd-Dufour 2002 was calibrated at IP3 = 10 µM — 200× above the
resting platelet IP3 = 50 nM. Extrapolated to that regime the
Markov chain gives Po⁴ = 4.21×10⁻⁴. Dolan's filtered IC has
Po⁴ = 1.65×10⁻⁵ (25× lower); the 25× gap is attributable to
Dolan's Monte Carlo filtering not constraining sub-state populations
to the Sneyd-Dufour equilibrium, not to a code bug.

At the Dolan IC the resulting IP3R basal leak (≈ 110 000 ions/s)
outpaces SERCA refill (≈ 30 000 ions/s at cyt = 100 nM) by 3.7×.
The DTS empties on a timescale of seconds.

No downstream parameter patch closes this gap. The fix must either:

1. Reduce the IP3R model's resting Po to a biologically appropriate
   level, or
2. Accept the pathological resting state and live with the documented
   limitation (current v0.2 baseline, #24 open).

This lab book documents option 1: replacing Sneyd-Dufour with the
deYoung-Keizer 1992 model, which has an explicit IP3-binding
activation gate that produces near-zero open probability at resting
IP3 concentrations.

## Why deYoung-Keizer 1992

Sneyd-Dufour 2002 was designed to reproduce the *dynamics* of IP3R
gating during stimulated conditions (fast Ca²⁺-driven transitions,
cooperative inactivation). It has no explicit IP3-binding term with
a saturable Kd; IP3 concentration appears only inside the φ-function
rate laws as a multiplicative scaling. Below the calibration regime
the channel does not gate off cleanly.

deYoung & Keizer 1992 (*PNAS* 89:9895-9899) model each IP3R subunit
as having three independent binding sites:

| Site | Ligand | Role |
|------|--------|------|
| 1    | IP3    | activation (channel opens when IP3 bound) |
| 2    | Ca²⁺   | activation (assists opening) |
| 3    | Ca²⁺   | inhibition (Ca²⁺-induced inactivation) |

The channel is only in the conducting state when sites 1 and 2 are
occupied and site 3 is unoccupied. This gives an explicit IP3
concentration dependence with saturable Kd:

    m∞ = [IP3/(IP3+d₁)] × [Ca/(Ca+d₅)]

where d₁ ≈ 0.13 µM is the IP3 half-saturation constant.

At IP3 = 50 nM:  IP3 gate fraction = 0.05/(0.05+0.13) = **0.28**
At IP3 = 10 µM:  IP3 gate fraction = 10.0/(10.0+0.13) = **0.99**

The channel is ~72% gated off by IP3 scarcity alone at rest.
Sneyd-Dufour has no equivalent gate.

The model was calibrated in Xenopus oocytes, the same expression
system as Sneyd-Dufour, and has been used extensively in platelet
and ER-Ca²⁺ modelling in the decades since (Bezprozvanny 1991
single-channel data; Wagner & Keizer 1994; Dupont et al. 2016).

## Model equations — Li-Rinzel 1994 simplification

Li & Rinzel 1994 (*J Theor Biol* 166:461-473) showed that if the
IP3-binding and Ca²⁺-activation kinetics are fast relative to
Ca²⁺-inhibition kinetics, sites 1 and 2 can be treated as being in
quasi-steady state. This collapses the 8-state deYoung-Keizer model
to a single differential equation for the inhibition variable h
(fraction of subunits with site 3 unoccupied):

    dh/dt = a₂ × [d₂ - (Ca_cyt + d₂) × h]             ... (1)

In quasi-steady state h → h∞ = d₂/(Ca_cyt + d₂).

The activation fraction in quasi-steady state:

    m∞(IP3, Ca) = [IP3/(IP3+d₁)] × [Ca/(Ca+d₅)]       ... (2)

For a homotetrameric channel (open when all 4 subunits are
activated and not inhibited):

    Po_channel = m∞(IP3, Ca)⁴ × h⁴                     ... (3)

Note: some implementations use m∞³ × h (Li-Rinzel's own notation);
we use the ⁴ exponent to match the Dolan/Purvis tetrameric
convention already in the flux formula and for thermodynamic
consistency with the cooperative gating assumption. This choice
should be tested during implementation (see §Measurement).

The Ca²⁺ flux equation is **unchanged**:

    J_IP3R = γ_IP3R × N_IP3R × Po_channel × (V_IM − E_Ca) × NA/(zF)

γ_IP3R = 10 pS, N_IP3R = 1 328 (Burkhart 2012 / Dolan Table 1),
V_IM = −0.060 V — all retained from the current model.

## Parameters

From deYoung & Keizer 1992 Table 1 and the Li-Rinzel 1994
simplification. All values must be verified against primary-source
PDF before being entered in code.

| Symbol | Description | Value | Unit | Source |
|--------|-------------|-------|------|--------|
| d₁ | IP3 activation half-saturation | 0.13 | µM | dYK92 Table 1: b₂/a₁ = 52/400 |
| d₂ | Ca²⁺ inhibition half-saturation | 1.049 | µM | dYK92 Table 1: b₄/a₄ |
| d₅ | Ca²⁺ activation half-saturation | 0.08234 | µM | dYK92 Table 1: b₆/a₅ |
| a₂ | Ca²⁺ inhibition on-rate (h dynamics) | 0.2 | µM⁻¹·s⁻¹ | dYK92 Table 1 |

These are the four parameters used in the Li-Rinzel reduced form.
All other deYoung-Keizer rate constants are subsumed into d₁, d₂,
d₅ via their equilibrium-constant definitions.

**At resting conditions** (IP3 = 0.05 µM, Ca_cyt = 0.1 µM):

    m∞ = (0.05/0.18) × (0.1/0.183) = 0.278 × 0.548 = 0.152
    h∞  = 1.049 / 1.149             = 0.913
    Po_channel = 0.152⁴ × 0.913⁴   = 5.33×10⁻⁴ × 0.695 = 3.7×10⁻⁴

Hmm — with the ⁴⁺⁴ exponents the resting Po is still ~3.7×10⁻⁴,
comparable to the Sneyd-Dufour value. This motivates testing the
alternative **m∞⁴ × h** formula (h only to first power):

    Po_channel = 0.152⁴ × 0.913    = 5.33×10⁻⁴ × 0.913 = 4.9×10⁻⁴

Still high. The real gain from deYoung-Keizer is through the
stronger IP3 dependence at stimulated conditions vs resting, not
through a large absolute resting-Po reduction — the question is
whether the *resting flux balance* works out, which depends on
what γ_IP3R was calibrated against.

**Revised expectation**: deYoung-Keizer does not produce a
dramatically lower absolute resting Po than Sneyd-Dufour at these
parameter values. The principal difference is the correct IP3
gating across the concentration range. After the model replacement
the resting-state *balance* (IP3R leak vs SERCA) may still require
γ_IP3R recalibration — this was anticipated as a contingency in the
Phase 1 risk register.

This is an important pre-implementation finding. It means:

1. The implementation should proceed as planned (deYoung-Keizer is
   still the correct model choice — it handles the IP3 range
   properly and is calibrated on Xenopus/Xenopus-like physiology).
2. We should expect that **γ_IP3R recalibration will be needed**
   as part of Phase 4, specifically to bring resting leak down
   to ≤ SERCA refill capacity at cyt = 100 nM.
3. The Phase 4 γ_IP3R retune is now biologically grounded (it is
   adjusting the single-channel conductance to match the specific
   cell type / experimental conditions) rather than a fudge to
   compensate for a wrong kinetic model.

## Code changes required

### `reconstruction/platelet/dataclasses/process/calcium_signalling.py`

**Remove:**
- `K_IP3R` dict (17 entries, lines ~126-148)
- All seven `_phi_*` helper functions (lines ~324-382)
- The six `IP3R_*[dts]` entries from `MOLECULE_NAMES` (n, o, a, i1, i2, s)
- The corresponding state reads from the ODE (`n`, `o`, `a`, `i1`, `i2`, `s`)
- The six `dy[_IDX['IP3R_*']] +=` lines
- The `ip3r_total`, `po_subunit`, `po_channel` computation block
- The comment block about Dolan convention vs /4 (lines ~529-542)

**Add:**
- `K_DYK` dict with four entries: `d1`, `d2`, `d5`, `a2`
- `N_IP3R = 1328` constant (replacing `ip3r_total` derived from sub-state sum)
- One new entry in `MOLECULE_NAMES`: `'IP3R_h[dts]'`
  (the inhibition variable; stored as a fractional count 0–N_IP3R)
- In `_ode_rhs`:
  - Read `ip3r_h_count = max(y[_IDX['IP3R_h[dts]']], 0.0)`
  - Compute `h = ip3r_h_count / N_IP3R` (fraction, 0–1)
  - Compute `m_inf = (ip3 / (ip3 + K_DYK['d1'])) * (ca_cyt / (ca_cyt + K_DYK['d5']))`
  - Compute `po_channel = (m_inf ** 4) * h` (or `m_inf**4 * h**4`; test both)
  - `n_ip3r_channels = N_IP3R` (constant, replaces `ip3r_total`)
  - h ODE: `dh_dt = K_DYK['a2'] * (K_DYK['d2'] - (ca_cyt + K_DYK['d2']) * h)`
  - `dy[_IDX['IP3R_h[dts]']] += dh_dt * N_IP3R`

The Nernst flux block (lines ~547-559) is **unchanged**.

Net species count change: −6 (remove n, o, a, i1, i2, s) + 1 (add h)
= **−5 species** from the ODE state vector.

### `reconstruction/platelet/dataclasses/internal_state.py`

**Remove** the six IP3R sub-state rows (IP3R_n, IP3R_o, IP3R_a,
IP3R_i1, IP3R_i2, IP3R_s) from the species table.

**Add** one row:
```
('IP3R_h[dts]',  5.110e-4,  1212,  'protein'),
```
where 1212 = round(h₀ × N_IP3R) = round(0.913 × 1328), the
pre-equilibrated initial condition at cyt = 100 nM.

### `reports/data/calcium-data-provenance.md`

Update the IP3R section to record:
- Sneyd-Dufour removed; deYoung-Keizer 1992 implemented
- Parameters sourced from dYK92 Table 1 / Li-Rinzel 1994
- Reason for change (calibration-regime mismatch)

### `models/platelet/tests/sim/test_regression.py` (or equivalent)

Update any hard-coded checks that depend on IP3R sub-state species
counts (IP3R_n etc.). If a regression test snapshots the species
list, it needs updating.

---

## No changes needed

- `GAMMA_IP3R_S`, `V_IM_V`, `NA_OVER_zF`, `RT_OVER_zF_V` — unchanged
- `K_SERCA`, `K_PMCA`, `K_CAM_PMCA`, `K_CAM`, `K_STIM`, `K_MWC` — unchanged
- `J_PM_LEAK_IONS_S` — unchanged (Phase 4 recalibration deferred)
- `SOCE` block — unchanged
- `MOLECULE_NAMES` order for all non-IP3R species — unchanged
- `CalciumDynamics` process class — no changes needed; it reads
  species list from `MOLECULE_NAMES` and calls `_ode_rhs`

---

## Expected outcomes

### Resting fixed point (`restConvergence.py`, 6 000 s, IP3 = 50 nM constant)

| Quantity | Current (Sneyd-Dufour) | Prediction | Target (Dolan) |
|----------|----------------------|------------|----------------|
| [Ca²⁺]_cyt | 2 240 nM | *see note* | ~100 nM |
| [Ca²⁺]_DTS | 0.07 µM | *see note* | 200–300 µM |

*Note:* As discussed in §Parameters, the absolute resting Po of
deYoung-Keizer at the standard parameters is not dramatically
different from Sneyd-Dufour. Resting-state improvement therefore
depends on whether γ_IP3R is recalibrated (Phase 4). The immediate
expected improvement is:

- The h variable should approach its quasi-steady state (h ≈ 0.91
  at cyt = 100 nM), confirming the ODE is behaving correctly.
- The IP3 dose-response is now correct: the model should produce
  a much larger Po increase during stimulation (IP3 rising from
  50 nM toward µM range) than Sneyd-Dufour does, because the
  deYoung-Keizer IP3 gate spans this range cleanly.

### Phase 3 validation (200 s, with / without Ca_ex)

| Criterion | Current baseline | Prediction |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| +Ca_ex peak | 393 nM ✓ | May shift; retest required |
| −Ca_ex peak | 325 nM ✓ | May shift; retest required |
| SOCE differential | 67 nM ✗ | Uncertain until γ_IP3R calibrated |
| Acceptance | 4/5 | Target ≥ 4/5; accept regression if γ_IP3R needs retuning |

The Phase 3 peaks may change because the deYoung-Keizer model's
IP3-driven transient dynamics are different from Sneyd-Dufour's. If
Phase 3 falls below 4/5 after this change, γ_IP3R is adjusted in
Phase 4 to restore the match before anything else is touched.

---

## How to measure success

### Step 1 — Verify h dynamics (immediate sanity check)

After implementing, run a 600 s simulation with IP3 = 50 nM constant
and no IP3 stimulus. Confirm:
- h settles near 0.91 (h∞ at cyt = 100 nM)
- m∞ ≈ 0.152 at cyt = 100 nM, IP3 = 50 nM
- Po_channel ≈ (expected value per chosen formula)
- IP3R flux at rest can be computed manually and compared to SERCA
  refill rate

### Step 2 — Resting convergence (`restConvergence.py`)

Run: `PYTHONPATH=$PWD python runscripts/manual/restConvergence.py`

Record:
- [Ca²⁺]_cyt at convergence
- [Ca²⁺]_DTS at convergence
- h value at convergence
- IP3R flux and SERCA flux at convergence (add diagnostic print if
  needed)

**Minimum acceptance:** DTS does not fully drain (DTS > 1 µM) within
6 000 s. Full acceptance (DTS > 50 µM) likely requires Phase 4
γ_IP3R recalibration.

### Step 3 — Phase 3 validation

Run: `PYTHONPATH=$PWD python runscripts/manual/runPhase3.py out/phase3_dyk/ --length 200`

Record all five acceptance criteria. Update `test_regression.py`
baselines to the new numbers. The target is ≥ 4/5; if Phase 3 dips
to 3/5 due to peak-band shifts, this is acceptable as a transitional
state pending Phase 4 recalibration, provided the direction of change
is documented.

### Step 4 — IP3 dose-response check (qualitative)

Run two 200 s simulations: one at IP3 = 50 nM constant (no stimulus)
and one with IP3 = 1 µM constant (saturating). Confirm that the
deYoung-Keizer model produces near-zero Ca²⁺ release at 50 nM and
substantial release at 1 µM — the IP3 gating should be qualitatively
correct.

---

## Open questions before coding

1. **Po exponent**: use `m∞⁴ × h` (inhibition applies once per channel)
   or `m∞⁴ × h⁴` (independent per subunit)? The Li-Rinzel paper
   uses `m∞³ × h` (three-subunit form). For consistency with the
   current Dolan tetrameric convention we will use `m∞⁴ × h` as
   the first implementation; test `m∞⁴ × h⁴` if resting Po is still
   too high after Phase 4.

2. **N_IP3R constant**: the current code derives `ip3r_total` by
   summing sub-state counts. In deYoung-Keizer, `N_IP3R = 1 328` is
   a constant. This simplifies the flux formula and removes the need
   to normalise by a varying total.

3. **γ_IP3R recalibration (Phase 4)**: should γ_IP3R be adjusted as
   part of this issue (#27) or deferred to #30? Recommendation:
   defer to #30 (Phase 4) so that #27 is a clean model-replacement
   commit and γ_IP3R tuning is a separate, documented calibration
   step. If Phase 3 collapses below 3/5 after the replacement, pull
   γ_IP3R retune forward into #27.

## Files to change

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `reconstruction/platelet/dataclasses/process/calcium_signalling.py` | Replace K_IP3R + φ-functions with K_DYK + h ODE (primary) |
| `reconstruction/platelet/dataclasses/internal_state.py` | Swap 6 IP3R sub-state rows for 1 IP3R_h row |
| `reports/data/calcium-data-provenance.md` | Update IP3R provenance section |
| `models/platelet/tests/sim/test_regression.py` | Update species-list / baseline snapshots |

---

## Implementation results (2026-05-11)

Implementation complete. All tests pass (8/8 regression, mypy clean).
Phase 3 validation maintains 4/5.

### Gating diagnostic (`checkIP3REquilibrium.py`)

Resting conditions (IP3 = 50 nM, Ca_cyt = 100 nM, Ca_DTS = 250 µM):

| Quantity | Value |
|----------|-------|
| m∞ | 0.1523 |
| h∞ | 0.913 |
| τ_h | 3.7 s |
| Po_channel = m∞⁴ × h | 4.92×10⁻⁴ |
| IP3R flux at rest | 3 349 000 ions/s (into cytosol) |

**Important clarification on the 110 000 ions/s figure in the design
doc above**: the 110 000 ions/s cited in §"Why this change" was
computed at the *Dolan-filtered initial conditions* (Po⁴ = 1.65×10⁻⁵),
not at the Sneyd-Dufour Markov equilibrium. At the Sneyd-Dufour ODE
equilibrium the actual resting flux was ~2 870 000 ions/s; the DYK
resting flux is ~3 350 000 ions/s. Both models therefore produce a
resting IP3R leak ~30–100× SERCA refill capacity. The 110 000 ions/s
figure belongs to the Dolan Monte-Carlo filtered state, which is not
a trajectory point in our ODE system.

### Resting convergence

At the DYK ODE fixed point (no IP3 forcing):

| Quantity | Sneyd-Dufour | deYoung-Keizer |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| [Ca²⁺]_cyt at convergence | ~2 211 nM | ~2 211 nM |
| [Ca²⁺]_DTS at convergence | ~0.07 µM | ~0.56 µM |

The DTS recovers somewhat (0.07 → 0.56 µM) because the DYK
Ca²⁺-inhibition gate (h → 0 as cyt rises) provides negative feedback
that partially caps the leak. The DTS is still not at a biologically
reasonable resting level; Phase 4 γ_IP3R recalibration is required.

### γ_IP3R recalibration targets (Phase 4, initial analysis)

To bring IP3R resting flux to the SERCA-matched range:

| Target flux | Required γ_IP3R | Reduction from 10 pS |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| 30 000 ions/s (SERCA lower bound) | 0.090 pS | 111× |
| 100 000 ions/s (SERCA upper bound) | 0.299 pS | 33× |

---

## Phase 4 — γ_IP3R recalibration (2026-05-11, issue #30)

### Analytical calibration

SERCA 6-state cycle steady-state flux solved at cyt = 100 nM,
DTS = 250 µM (linear system):

| SERCA sub-state | Steady-state population |
|----------------|------------------------|
| E2 | 5 803 |
| E1 | 5 710 |
| E1Ca | 81 |
| E1PCa | 101 |
| E2PCa | 84 |
| E2P | 113 |

Cycle flux J = 56 285 cycles/s → **SERCA Ca²⁺ efflux = 112 570 ions/s**.

For balance at cyt = 100 nM:

    γ_required = SERCA_flux / (N × Po × driving × NA/zF)
               = 112 570 / (1 328 × 4.91×10⁻⁴ × 0.1605 × 3.122×10¹⁸)
               = 112 570 / (3.27×10¹⁷)
               = **0.344 pS**

Set: `GAMMA_IP3R_S = 0.35e-12` (rounded to 2 s.f.).

### SERCA initial conditions — two-state vs six-state equilibrium

The previous SERCA initial conditions used the two-state (E1 ↔ E1Ca)
binding equilibrium:

    E1Ca/E1 = k_bind_f · cyt² / k_bind_r = 1000 · 0.01 / 10 = 1.0

This gives E1Ca = E1 = 2 963. However the correct full-cycle quasi-
steady-state ratio is:

    E1Ca/E1 = k_bind_f · cyt² / (k_bind_r + k_phos_f)
            = 1000 · 0.01 / (10 + 700) = 10/710 = 0.0141

The fast phosphorylation drain (k_phos_f = 700 s⁻¹ >> k_bind_r = 10 s⁻¹)
holds E1Ca much lower than the 2-state approximation suggests. The
old E1Ca = 2 963 was 36× too large; the phosphorylation burst at t = 0
(v_phos = 700 × 2 963 = 2.07M events/s) rapidly depleted cytosolic
Ca²⁺ below the d₅ = 82 nM activation threshold, trapping the system
at the low-Ca²⁺ attractor (~2.6 nM).

**Fix**: initialise SERCA to the 6-state cycle steady state (E1 = 5 710,
E2 = 5 803, E1Ca = 81, E1PCa = 101, E2PCa = 84, E2P = 113). This
eliminates the t = 0 burst.

### Outcome of Phase 4 calibration

After applying γ = 0.35 pS and the corrected SERCA initial conditions:
- All 21 regression + Phase 3 tests pass.
- Initial conditions: cyt = 100 nM, DTS = 250 µM ✓
- Long-time resting convergence (600 s, no IP3 forcing):
  cyt ≈ 122 nM, DTS ≈ 327 µM (still drifting; DTS overfills without
  a DTS Ca²⁺ buffer).

**The DTS overfill is expected**: without calreticulin (CALR, Phase 2 /
#28), the DTS has no luminal buffering. SERCA pumps Ca²⁺ in faster
than IP3R (at a balanced γ) removes it; DTS rises until SERCA stalls
or reverses against the thermodynamic gradient. CALR will provide the
~508 000 Ca²⁺-binding sites needed to stabilise DTS at 250 µM.

Phase 3 validation passes 4/5 (unchanged from deYoung-Keizer Phase 1)
because the 200 s IP3-stimulated transient starts from the correct
initial conditions and the peak dynamics are dominated by the fast
IP3R/SERCA/CaM kinetics, not the slow DTS drift.

**Next step**: Phase 2 (CALR buffer, issue #28). After CALR, γ_IP3R
may need minor re-tuning in the full DTS-buffered context.

## Biology limitations and assumptions (added 2026-05-11)

A review of today's work against the literature flagged several known
gaps and inherited assumptions. The canonical list lives in
`reports/dissertation-notes.md`; this section is the in-context summary
for the lab book record.

### Ca²⁺ buffering — cytosol
Only calmodulin modelled; resting buffering ratio 3.5:1 (bound:free),
versus the 50:1–100:1 typical of non-muscle cells. Major non-CaM cyt
Ca²⁺ binders we omit: **gelsolin** (~250 000 copies, multi-site EF-hand-
like binding, Kd ~0.1–1 µM), annexins, Ca·ATP. Today's pass adds a
coarse-grained gelsolin-like buffer to close part of the gap — see
§"Cytosolic buffering pass" below.

### Ca²⁺ buffering — DTS
Only the STIM1 EF-hand modelled; resting DTS buffering ~9% bound.
Real ER/SR is 95–99% buffered (CALR, HSP90B1, CALU, etc.). This is the
direct cause of the long-time DTS runaway in the 6 000 s convergence
run. Phase 2 (#28) is the dominant fix.

### Flux-rate calibration
- **γ_IP3R = 0.35 pS is coupled to SERCA constants** — it is the value
  that balances our SERCA flux at the Dolan resting state, not an
  independent measurement. If SERCA constants change in v0.3, γ must
  be re-derived.
- **SERCA flux at 100 nM (112 570 ions/s) is probably 2–5× too high.**
  Literature SERCA3b Vmax (30–50 cycles/s at saturation) with Km =
  0.7–1.1 µM predicts ~24 000 ions/s. The Purvis 2008 / Dode 2002 rate
  constants we use appear to over-estimate the SERCA3b pump rate at
  resting Ca²⁺. v0.3+ should re-derive from primary sources.
- **PM leak = 75 ions/s** is roughly 2× the upper Sage & Rink 1985
  estimate (~10–40 ions/s).

### Methodological choices
- **Po = m∞⁴ × h**, not m∞³ × h (Li-Rinzel original): chosen for
  consistency with Dolan's tetrameric Po⁴ convention. Sensitivity:
  switching to m∞³ × h raises Po 6× → γ_IP3R would drop to ~0.06 pS.

### Inherited / fixed
- **Cytoplasm volume = 6 fL** (Burkhart / Dolan convention; real
  platelets vary 4–7 fL).
- **Single SERCA isoform (SERCA3b)** — real platelets express both
  SERCA2b and SERCA3.
- **Single IP3R isoform (ITPR2)** — real platelets express all three.

Each of these is logged in `reports/dissertation-notes.md` with the
"why it matters" framing for the write-up.

---

## Cytosolic buffering pass (added 2026-05-11)

### Why "scaffold-only"

The cytosolic buffering ratio in real platelets is ~50:1 (bound:free;
Sage & Rink 1985), dominated by gelsolin (~250 000 copies, multi-site
EF-hand-like Ca²⁺ binding) plus annexins, Ca·ATP, and others. Our model
includes only calmodulin, giving a ratio of ~3.5:1.

Adding gelsolin at full biological copy number was tested analytically:
with N_GSN = 250 000 and Kd = 1 µM, the buffering ratio jumps to ~60:1.
For a fast-equilibrium 1:1 buffer:

    Δca_free  =  Δca_total / (1 + κ_total)

so peak Ca²⁺ during the IP3 transient drops from ~390 nM to ~130 nM,
which falsifies Phase 3 (lower bound 266 nM for +Ca_ex, 228 nM for
−Ca_ex). The existing IP3R / SERCA fluxes are calibrated against the
Dolan 2014 under-buffered model and cannot supply enough Ca²⁺ to a
fully-buffered cytosol to reach Dolan's measured peak heights.

Closing the cytosolic-buffer gap therefore requires a *coupled*
re-calibration of IP3 forcing strength and/or γ_IP3R. That is genuine
v0.3+ work, not a Phase 4.5 sub-task.

### What was implemented

Structural scaffold only: gelsolin species, ODE term, and initial
conditions, at N_GSN = 5 000 (50× below biological). This:

1. Establishes the data flow and species naming for v0.3 to scale up
2. Adds a small but real buffer contribution (κ rises from 3.5 to ~5)
3. Does not perturb Phase 3 (peaks shift by < 5%)
4. Documents the biology gap in code and lab book for the dissertation

| Parameter | Scaffold (now) | Biological (v0.3+) |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------|
| `N_GSN` | 5 000 | ~250 000 (Burkhart 2012) |
| `K_GSN['k_on']` | 100 µM⁻¹·s⁻¹ | 100 µM⁻¹·s⁻¹ (unchanged) |
| `K_GSN['k_off']` | 100 s⁻¹ → Kd = 1 µM | Kd = 0.1–1 µM range |
| Bound at rest | 455 ions | ~22 700 ions |
| κ contribution | ~0.13 | ~57 |
| Resting cyt ratio | 4.7:1 | ~60:1 |

Files: `calcium_signalling.py` (MOLECULE_NAMES, K_GSN, _ode_rhs),
`internal_state.py` (initial conditions). All 21 tests still pass.
The biology disclosure is in the `K_GSN` block in
`calcium_signalling.py` and in `reports/dissertation-notes.md §1.1`.

## Phase 2 — buffer biology (2026-05-11, issue #28)

Added the dominant DTS luminal buffer (CALR) plus a calibrated cytosolic
buffer scale-up, with a coupled IP3R / SERCA flux retune.

### Components added

**Calreticulin C-domain** (low-affinity, high-capacity):
- 20 324 CALR molecules × 25 sites = 508 100 sites
- Kd = 1 mM, k_off = 1 000 s⁻¹ (fast equilibrium)
- Source: Burkhart 2012; Vassilakos 1998; Baksh & Michalak 1991
- At resting DTS [Ca²⁺] = 250 µM: 101 620 bound (20% occupancy)

**Calreticulin P-domain** (high-affinity, slow release):
- 1 site per CALR molecule × 20 324 molecules = 20 324 sites
- Kd = 1 µM, k_off = 1 s⁻¹ (~1 s residence time)
- Always saturated at resting DTS [Ca²⁺] (occupancy > 99.6 %)
- Releases its ~20 k Ca²⁺ over ~1 s when DTS [Ca²⁺] drops below Kd

**Coarse-grained cytosolic buffer (gelsolin proxy)**:
- Scaled from 5 000 scaffold sites → 800 000 (~160 000 gelsolin × 5 sites)
- Kd = 1 µM, k_off = 100 s⁻¹ (fast)
- Source: Burkhart 2012 / Yin & Stossel 1979 (range 50 000–280 000 GSN)

**IP3R / SERCA flux retune** (coupled with buffer addition):
- γ_IP3R: 0.35 pS → **0.175 pS** (halved)
- SERCA k_bind_f: 1 000 → **500 µM⁻²·s⁻¹** (halved to maintain resting balance)
- SERCA initial conditions re-derived from 6-state cycle steady state at
  the new k_bind_f: E1 = 5 825, E2 = 5 873, E1Ca = 41, E1PCa = 51,
  E2PCa = 43, E2P = 57 (cycle flux = 57 426 ions/s ≈ new resting IP3R
  flux of 57 500 ions/s).

### Why the retune was necessary

Adding CALR alone made the resting DTS biologically correct (cyt = 116 nM,
DTS = 257 µM stable) but exploded the cyt peak to **~5 000 nM** during
the Dolan IP3 transient. Diagnostic:

> At the cyt peak (cyt = 360 nM, ip3 = 0.25 µM), IP3R Po = m∞⁴ × h ≈
> 0.062 — gives peak flux ~13 M ions/s. The total DTS Ca²⁺ (free 38 k +
> CALR-bound 102 k + STIM-bound 4 k = 144 k ions) drains in ~11 ms.
> CALR's C-domain (fast k_off) cannot retain Ca²⁺ at this drain rate;
> it simply gives up its buffer load to the free pool, which then flows
> through IP3R. The peak height is set by the buffer-vs-IP3R-flux
> integral over the transient.

To bring the cyt peak back into the Dolan ±30 % band required either
(a) much more cyt buffering or (b) lower IP3R flux. Both were needed: GSN
at biological copy number (~160 000 molecules) for buffering, and γ_IP3R
halved to lower the transient flux. SERCA k_bind_f halved alongside to
preserve resting balance.

### Outcome

| Metric | Before Phase 2 | After Phase 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Resting cyt (steady state) | 116 nM | **109 nM** |
| Resting DTS (steady state) | 257 µM | **264 µM** |
| Resting IP3R flux | 115 k ions/s | 57.5 k ions/s |
| Resting SERCA flux | 113 k ions/s | 57.4 k ions/s |
| Peak IP3R flux | ~13 M ions/s | ~6.5 M ions/s |
| Peak cyt (+Ca_ex) | 393 nM | **345 nM** ✓ (in 315–585) |
| Peak cyt (−Ca_ex) | 325 nM | **345 nM** ✓ (in 192–358) |
| Phase 3 score | 4/5 | 4/5 |
| Cyt buffering ratio (rest) | 3.5:1 | ~200:1 |
| DTS buffering ratio (rest) | 9% bound | ~73% bound |
| Dry mass | 196.8 fg | 220.0 fg (+ ~24 fg buffer proteins) |
| 21 tests | 21 pass | 21 pass |

### Known limitations from this commit

1. **DTS still empties fully (≈ 0 µM) during the transient.** The C-domain
   releases at fast equilibrium and the P-domain's slow release isn't
   enough to retain free [Ca²⁺]_DTS above zero. Real biology likely
   retains ~50–100 µM free DTS during stimulation. Closing this gap
   requires either further IP3R rate-constant work, additional DTS
   buffers (HSP90B1, CALU — #25), or P2X1 / faster SOCE.

2. **The SOCE differential is still ~0 nM** (Dolan reports ~100 nM).
   This is a peak-timing issue: the cyt peak occurs at t ≈ 1 s after
   IP3 onset, before SOCE / STIM1 dimerization has activated. Possible
   fixes:
   - Slower IP3 forcing rise (peak occurs later, SOCE catches up)
   - Faster STIM1 dimer / Orai1 coupling
   - P2X1 contribution to +Ca_ex condition specifically
   See `reports/dissertation-notes.md §4` for a full discussion.

3. **Cyt buffering ratio of ~200:1 is higher than Sage & Rink 1985's
   ~50:1**. This is the calibration penalty for keeping the
   Dolan-inherited IP3R flux levels high. A v0.3+ rederivation of the
   IP3R rate constants (separate from the SERCA-rate question already
   in `dissertation-notes §3.2`) would let GSN drop closer to 50:1.

4. **Same SERCA-rate over-estimate as documented in dissertation notes
   §3.2** — halving k_bind_f mitigates but doesn't address the
   underlying calibration question.
